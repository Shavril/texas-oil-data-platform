"""Extract Root, Completion, and New Location records from the Well Bore
Database (dbf900.ebc).

Segment layout is documented in docs/data_wells.md, derived from
data/raw/wells/wba091_well-bore-database.pdf. Unlike the production and
P-4 tapes (deeply nested hierarchies), this tape is a flat fan-out: every
segment type (02-28) is a direct child of the most recent Root (01)
record. Root carries the well's API number but no district/lease key;
Completion (02) carries its own (district, lease_nbr, well_nbr) directly —
matching the production/P-4 lease key — but New Location (13) only
carries county + lat/long, tied to a specific well only by its position
in the file. This module stamps api_number (from Root) onto every child
record so Completion and New Location can be joined back together later.
