"""Extract Root-segment records from the P-4 Operator/Lease Database (p4f606.ebc).

Only the Root segment (key '01') is parsed — it carries the lease key
(district_code, lease_nbr) and the current operator number, which is all
that's needed to bridge production leases to P-5 organization records.
Segment layout is documented in docs/data_p4_operators.md, derived from
data/raw/operators/p4-user-manual_p4a002_feb2015.pdf.
