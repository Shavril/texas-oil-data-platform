"""Shared pandera validation helpers.

Every schema in this package mixes two check tiers, both expressed as
ordinary pandera Checks:

  - hard checks (the default, raise_warning=False): a violation
    contributes to a SchemaErrors failure. `validate()` re-raises this as
    ValidationError, halting the pipeline. Used for structural guarantees
    that downstream code depends on -- required columns, key uniqueness,
    known enumerations.
  - soft checks (`Check(..., raise_warning=True)`): a violation is caught
    as a SchemaWarning and logged, but does not stop the run. Used for
    known data-quality quirks documented in docs/data_*.md "Known Issues"
    that are informational rather than pipeline-breaking.
